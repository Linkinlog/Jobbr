# Jobbr

**Jobbr** is a simple cross-platform system utility designed to:
- Execute system commands (e.g., ping, system info).
- Run as a daemon on macOS for always-on availability.

This repository includes a macOS installer (`.pkg`) that installs the Jobbr binary to `/usr/local/bin` and configures a Launch Daemon to start Jobbr on boot.

## Features
- **Ping Support**: Send a network ping to a target host.
- **System Info**: Retrieve the hostname and IP address of the system.
- **HTTP API**: Simple JSON-based API for remote command execution.

## Installation

### macOS
1. **Download and Install:**
   - Download the `jobbr.pkg` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/linkinlog/jobbr/releases).
   - Double-click to install.

2. **What the Installer Does:**
   - Installs the `jobbr` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`.
   - Copies the `jobbr.plist` Launch Daemon file to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`.

3. **Start on Boot:**
   - The installer enables Jobbr to start on system boot using the Launch Daemon.

### Verification
After installation, logs will be generated in `/tmp/jobbr.log`.

You can verify the installation by checking the Jobbr binary and Launch Daemon file:
```bash
which jobbr
# Output: /usr/local/bin/jobbr

ls /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.linkinlog.jobbr.plist
# Output: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.linkinlog.jobbr.plist
```
